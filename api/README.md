The School Management API built on Flask is a RESTful API that allows clients to manage students, teachers, courses, and grades. 
The API provides endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting data related to these resources. 
Clients can retrieve a list of all students, teachers, courses, or grades or create new instances of these resources. 
The API returns standard HTTP status codes and JSON error messages for all responses.

The API has several endpoints, including /students, /courses, and /scores. The /students endpoint allows clients to retrieve a list of all students or create new student instances.

Clients can also paginate results by providing a page and per_page query parameter. The API returns responses in JSON format, making it easy for clients to parse the data and use it in their applications.

The API returns standard HTTP status codes and JSON error messages for all responses. Some common errors include 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, and 500 Internal Server Error.
